# credit-risk-classification


Welcome to my submission for the Supervised Learning Challenge in module 20 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in supervised Machine Learning using the sk-learn library.


# Challenge Description
In this assignment, the objective was to develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending data. By employing a Logistic Regression model, we aimed to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk, providing insights for better risk management in lending practices. The analysis involved data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation through various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Resources Used

Challenges I drew heavily from include the following:
 - The Linear Regression Activity
 - The Predicting Sales Activity
 - The Predicting Diabetes Activity
 - The Classifying Social Media Influencers Activity





These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, helped teach us the following:
- How to instantiate, fit, and use linear regression models
- How to perform predicitons
- What is a confusion matrix and how to read it
- How to interpret the classification report
- How to interpret a healthy score 

 






 ## Additional Resources
For syntax that I was not familiar with, I used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkely Bootcamp, Scikit-Learn Documentation, and ChatGPT.
