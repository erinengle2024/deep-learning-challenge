# Deep Learning Challenge


Welcome to my submission for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Challenge in module 21 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency with neural network models and  using the Tensorflow library.


# Challenge Description
In this assignment, we built and optimized a deep learning neural network to predict the success of funding applicants for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. Using a dataset of over 34,000 organizations, we preprocessed the data, created and trained multiple neural network models, and evaluated their performance. The goal was to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%, with the best model reaching approximately 72.68% accuracy after optimization attempts.

# Resources Used

Challenges I drew heavily from include the following:
 - The Over the Moon Activity
 - The Auto Optimization Solution Activity
 - The Getting Real Activity
 - The Detecting Myopia Activity 





These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, helped teach us the following:
- How to instantiate, fit, and use nerual network models
- How to use the TensorFlow library
- How to adjust models for Optomization
- How to perform data preprocessing
- How to save files in h5 format and download from Google Colab

 






 ## Additional Resources
For syntax that I was not familiar with, I used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkely Bootcamp, TensorFlown Documentation, and ChatGPT.
